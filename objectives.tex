The main objectives of the present Thesis Project are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item To describe the world events, technological developments, and architectural movements that contributed to urbanization acceleration during the 20th century.
\item Most greenhouse gas emissions occur during the manufacture of materials. In consequence, this study aims to compile data on current emission reduction efforts, including technological advancements (material production methods) and decarbonization roadmaps to reach the Net Zero target by 2050 stated in the Paris Agreement.
\end{enumerate}
