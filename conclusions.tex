The main conclusions of the present thesis project are the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Fully decarbonizing the construction sector is a key component to remain on-track with the Paris Agreementâ€™s Net Zero emissions by 2050. Technologies will likely be deployed in waves, with demand-side interventions influenced by global events, and nascent technologies such as CCS, electrification, biomass reductants and hydrogen substitution becoming important thereafter, reducing the involvement cost.
\item Crucial demand-side approaches include measures to deliver equivalent services with less material use (reducing raw material mining), reductions in material waste (\textit{e.g.} from prefabricated elements), and efficiency in design (such as deconstruction design, reuse of materials and improving product longevity).
\end{enumerate}
